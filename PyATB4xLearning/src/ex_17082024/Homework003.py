### Task #3
# - Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# - What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# - What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?


"""
1. Difference between = operator and == operator: ->

= operator is called as assignment operator, where we can assign some value to the identifier/variable name.
Ex - x = 10 -> here value 10 is assigned to variable 'x'

== operator is called as comparison operator or equality operator, where we can compare the value between right
and left side of the operator.
Ex -
x = 10
if x == 10 :
print("Equal")

2. ** operator in Python: ->

** operator is used for exponentiation, where we can provide the power of one value to another.
Ex -
x = 2**3  -> here x's value will be determined as '2 to the power of 3 = 8'

3. ^ operator in Python: ->

^ operator is known as bitwise operator where it compares each bit and set is as 1 if only one is 1,
or if both are 1 or both are 0 then it set the value as 0

6 ^ 4 = 2

6 = 0000000000000110
4 = 0000000000000100
--------------------
2 = 0000000000000010
